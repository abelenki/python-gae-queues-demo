## Usage

If you haven't already, first you need to create a Google App Engine app to
house your queue. There is a sample app directory under "app/" if you need it:

	/path/to/appcfg.py update app

Then, install the requirements using pip or your favorite tool, and run the demo.

	pip install -r requirements.txt
	# or easy_install google-api-python-client
	python demo.py
